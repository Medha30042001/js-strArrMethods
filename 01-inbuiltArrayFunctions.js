Q: 1
Solve all these questions using inbuilt functions of arrays & strings
1.
Question:
You have the following array:
const fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange'];
Write a code snippet to:

Add 'grape' to the end of the array using an appropriate inbuilt array method.
Remove 'apple' from the beginning of the array using an inbuilt array method.
Expected Output:
After the operations, the array should look like this: ['banana', 'orange', 'grape'].

2.
Question:
You have a string:
const sentence = ' JavaScript is fun ';
Write a code snippet to:

Remove extra spaces at the beginning and end of the string using a relevant string method.
Convert the string to uppercase using another string method.
Split the string into an array of words using an inbuilt string method.
Expected Output:
['JAVASCRIPT', 'IS', 'FUN']

3.
Question:
Given the array:
const numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
Write a code snippet to:

Extract the sub-array [20, 30, 40] using an inbuilt array method.
Reverse the order of this sub-array using another array method.
Combine it back with the rest of the original array elements in reversed order using array concatenation.
Expected Output:
The final array should look like this: [50, 40, 30, 20, 10].

4.
Question:
You are given a list of email addresses in a single string:
const emails = 'john@example.com, jane.doe@company.com, user123@gmail.com';
Write a code snippet to:

Split the string into an array of individual email addresses using an appropriate string method.
For each email, extract only the username (the part before @) using a combination of string methods.
Join the extracted usernames back into a single string, separated by semicolons (;), using an inbuilt array method.
Expected Output:
'john; jane.doe; user123'
