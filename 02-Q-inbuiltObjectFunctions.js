Q: 2
Solve all these questions using inbuilt functions of objects
Q1: Get keys and values
Question: You are given an object:

const car = {
  brand: 'Toyota',
  model: 'Corolla',
  year: 2020
};
Write a code snippet to:

Get all keys of the object using an inbuilt object method.
Get all values of the object using an inbuilt object method.
Print both arrays.
Expected Output:

Keys: ['brand', 'model', 'year']
Values: ['Toyota', 'Corolla', 2020]
Q2: Add new property without mutating
Question: You are given the object:

const employee = { name: 'Rahul', designation: 'Developer' };
Write a code snippet to:

Create a new object by adding a property salary with value 50000 without changing the original object.
Print both the original and the new object.
Expected Output:

Original: { name: 'Rahul', designation: 'Developer' }
New: { name: 'Rahul', designation: 'Developer', salary: 50000 }
Q3: Merge two objects
Question: You are given two objects:

const objA = { x: 1, y: 2 };
const objB = { y: 3, z: 4 };
Write a code snippet to:

Merge both objects into a new object using an inbuilt method.
Print the merged object.
Expected Output:

{ x: 1, y: 3, z: 4 }
Q4: Freeze an object
Question: You are given an object:

const settings = {
  theme: 'dark',
  notifications: true
};
Write a code snippet to:

Freeze the object using an inbuilt method so that no new properties can be added or modified.
Try to modify a property and add a new one (it should not work).
Print the final object to confirm changes didnâ€™t apply.
Q5 Check if a property exists in an object
Question: You are given an object:

const book = {
  title: 'Atomic Habits',
  author: 'James Clear',
  price: 499
};
Write a code snippet to:

Check if the object has the property 'author' using an inbuilt method.
Check if the property 'publisher' exists.
Print appropriate messages for both cases.
